TODO

## Notes

- Write `Task` class
	- Should abstract away the logic that runs the task based on if the process is running
	- Separates the WindowAction
- Use argument parser
- Write Wrapper for Window functions

### Potential Improvements

- Could maybe work better with autohotkey
	- https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/lib/WinGet.htm
